## Flux Chat Example

This is the Facebook [flux-chat](https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples/flux-chat)
example re-written in NuclearJS to demonstate the differences in the libraries as well as to show how Getters are used.

## Running

You must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed on your computer.
From the root project directory run these commands from the command line:

`npm install`

This will install all dependencies.

To build the project, first run this command:

`npm start`

After starting the watcher, you can open `index.html` in your browser to
open the app.
